Here are the rules of my original discretionary based trading strategy, this one was developed to trade trending equities of Indian markets, while filtering false trade signals from ADX trend based indicator. Well anyways:

I am giving you a trading strategy based on the ADX and DMI indicators, ADX is set with a period of 13, and an offset of 8 i.e., (13,8)

Rules for Entry Long:

+DMI & -DMI should be crossing over, in a divergent state with + DMI above the -DMI.
+DMI > 25.
ADX ≥ 25 but ≤ 50.
Volume of candle ≥ (2 or 1.5)* Moving average Volume(39 or 78).
After the DMI crossover, the highest volume candle of the present trend should carry higher volume than the last 30+ candles.
If there is a consolidation pattern breakout, we MIGHT take entry without the ADX confirmation rule i.e., rule no. 3, as I observed the ADX to be lagging in breakout of consolidation patterns.
Throughout the strategy we will ignore the Volume of the first 5-min candle of the trading session i.e., the 9:15 candle.
Entry will only be taken when the difference in both the DMIs > 20.
I hope the logic for each and every rule appears to be clear;
I chose the volume period as 39 or 78 in rule number-4 simply because there are total 78, 5-min trading candles in a single session, so either the MA volume should be twice of a session's worth candles in the past or half a session's worth i.e., 39. With some stocks the 78 period works better, with others it's the 39 which gives clean signals.

Rules for long exit:

For long exits, book profits near the previous swing highs.
Since most stocks were trading ATHs during the last 3 months, it would be considerate to keep a big target at entry signals with a small SL, also I personally choose to trail SL in such market conditions.
Rules for short entry:

-DMI & +DMI should be crossing over, in a divergent state with -DMI above the +DMI.
-DMI > 25.
ADX ≥ 25 but ≤ 50.
Volume of candle ≥ (2 or 1.5)* Moving average Volume(39 or 78).
After the DMI crossover, the highest volume candle of the present trend should carry higher volume than the last 30+ candles.
If there is a consolidation pattern breakout, we MIGHT take entry without the ADX confirmation rule i.e., rule no. 3, as I observed the ADX to be lagging in breakout of consolidation patterns.
Throughout the strategy we will ignore the Volume of the first 5-min candle of the trading session i.e., the 9:15 candle.
Entry will only be taken when the difference in both the DMIs > 20.
Rules for short exits:

For short exits, simply book profits at previous swing lows.
